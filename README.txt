Description
===========
   This project is to develop a mobile client application that would allow users to search for restaurants based on a set of criteria, such as type of food, ethnicity, and geographical location. This application is currently limited to the restaurants in Toronto area. The user would view the details about a restaurant including the health check status, and the driving and TTC direction to the restaurant.
